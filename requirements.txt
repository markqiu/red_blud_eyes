# This project uses `uv` for dependency management
# For pip compatibility, install uv and run: uv pip compile pyproject.toml
# Or use pyproject.toml directly with modern pip versions

# For cloud platforms that require requirements.txt,
# generate with: uv pip compile -o requirements.txt pyproject.toml
